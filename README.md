Stereo Vision algorithms and the Euler- and Quaternion-based IKM

The kinematic_model_Paper3.py file contains the forward and inverse kinematic model (both for Euler and Quaternion). Besides that the calcualtion of the Jacobian matrix as well as a symbolic computation (sympy) are included.

The manual_depth_Paper3.py file contains the computer vision algorithm for the extraction of the handle coordinates based on the markers. Also the interface with the kinematic_model_Paper3.py is given.

The plotting_numeric_Paper3.py file contains all helper functions needed for plotting.
